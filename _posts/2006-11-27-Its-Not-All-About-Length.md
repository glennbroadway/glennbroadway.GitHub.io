title: It's Not All About Length
---

This week's Gamasutra Question of the Week is:

> How important is the length of a video game for you, as someone involved in the industry? Is there a particular 'hours per $ purchase price' that makes sense, or are there other sensible measures of replayability beyond simple linear mission modes? How should the game industry address this problem in the future?
 
I can see Richard Bartle [gnashing his teeth in anger](https://www.youhaventlived.com/qblog/2006/QBlog230806A.html) as I type. The question is so badly worded that it's almost a joke. It shifts from 'length of a video game' to 'measure of replayability' (whatever that means) half way through and then sums up by asking how this problem should be dealt with - who said there was a problem?. I was going to answer on the Gamasutra site, because it's a subject I do have opinions about, but I think I'd best keep my answer to this little read forum instead...

The article which leads to the question stems from a letter by Zoe Nichols. You should [take a moment to read it](https://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11846) but in short she'd go for quantity over quality if there was no other choice. Her ideal, I think, would be cutting edge technology in a game which offers 24+ hours of gameplay. She thinks that's what $70 should buy her... I disagree with her wholeheartedly, except perhaps for that last point, but only because I think $70 is far too expensive for a video game.

Personally I like to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I've probably completed less than a quarter of the games I have played. In fact it's probably less than that(can you have less than 'less than'?). Here's a list including one or two from each of the platforms I have owned over the years:

- Dr Who and the Mines of Terror (BBC)
- Cybercon 3 (Atari ST)
- Doom (PC)
- Warcraft (PC)
- Crash Bandicoot (Playstation)
- Lander (PC)
- Advance Wars (GBA)
- Burnout 3 (PS2)
- Mercury (PSP)

These are all games that I really enjoyed and I didn't complete any of them. I could probably list all the games I have actually completed from memory (it would include Another World (ST), Out Run (Arcade),  Wario 4 (GBA), Half Life 1 & 2 (PC)). And often it's a complete let down to play right to the end anyway (Half Life 1 being a prime example). Unlike Zoe I'd go for 6 hours of gameplay over 24 in most cases. Perhaps not in games like Burnout, but certainly in anything which purports to having some sort of story. I hate story in games, but levels are okay, and often the levels are wrapped in a story for fairly obvious reasons.

My dislike of long games is coupled with a disdain for the way games are priced. Give me Advance wars with 10 levels for £10, then sell more levels for £5 a pack. Half Life could have been half as long and still satisfied me.  Some games are just so hard that it seems no-one will ever see their denouements (Cybercon 3, Lander). And for those cutting edge, virtual worlds; those story driven adventures into alternate realities which are going to cost £40 no matter how long they are, what I want is six hours of amazing game play. Six hours of faultless, coherent escapism. I can think of nothing worse than a game like Deus Ex. A sprawling melodrama ruined by endless inconsistencies (it aims to be a real world but, as usual, only 10% of the doors open and half of the items in the world can never be collected).

If the scope of a game was reduced dramatically but the effort and attention to detail refocused then we might start to see truly convincing game worlds. Set a game entirely in an office block, but make everything work. Every phone, vending machine, computer, drawer, trolley, everything. I know some people in the industry are aiming for this. I had the pleasure to once work (indirectly) with Paul Holmes who always dreamed (I think) of creating truly convincing game worlds (see [Hunter](https://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=512), one of his earliest efforts). The best examples are often still text based games (MUD 2 continually surprised me right up until the moment I prized myself away from it).

In fact, I'd go one further. I'd be happy if I sat down to play a game on my XBOX 360 knowing that the experience would last 45 minutes, and no longer. A tense, action packed race against the clock set in a game world which was so densely populated with convincing characters, objects and incidents and so amazingly rendered that I wouldn't have time ponder it's inevitable inadequacies. Then, when I'm done (be it success or failure) I could chose to play again, perhaps making the same choices, perhaps different, or maybe as a different character entirely and on a completely different arc.

It's not that I've got a short attention span or anything, I just think that games are too long (and often formulaic). It reminds me of Lost and 24 - except with games there's no advertising revenue driving the content on into an almost never ending stream of mediocrity. I want my games to be like Edge Of Darkness. I want a six part drama of world class proportions not 144 episodes of never ending, repetitious dross! (And I want Bob Peck to come back to life, dammit.)

But if Zoe's in tune with the masses (and I fear she is) then I'm not going to get it am I?
