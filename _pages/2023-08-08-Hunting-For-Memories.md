If you’ve met me before then you’ve heard this story, because I tell everyone. When I was about ten I managed to achieve the dream - my picture was featured on Tony Hart’s Gallery.

Or was it?

I’m starting to doubt if it ever happened. There’s certainly no evidence that I can find. And believe me I have searched high and low. Even going as far as contacting the BBC archives (they never respond).

I remember the picture - a pencil drawing of R2D2 (it was around 1980, the height of Star Wars mania). I remember receiving the ‘small prize’ (as promised by Tony when he warned you that he wouldn’t be able to return your artwork. It was a box of Reeves watercolour paints. Useless to me as I hate painting and anyway, I’m colour-blind.) But unfortunately I have never been able to find the episode. I did wonder if Tony Hart’s programmes might have been a victim of the big [BBC tape wiping scandal] (https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/501607/wipe-out-when-bbc-kept-erasing-its-own-history) but it seems that ceased in the mid 70s. And yet there are just a handful of his shows archived online, and the one I’m searching for isn’t amongst them.

I recently found a new clip of the Gallery on Facebook and amongst the various paintings was this rendering of a Storm Trooper and Darth Vader by Robin Simpson, aged 11. My heart raced as they would often pair similar pictures on the gallery, but alas, not this time.
