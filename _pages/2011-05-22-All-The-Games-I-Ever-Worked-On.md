Yes, I know that title ends with a preposition, but I’m a maverick. I thought I would finally try to document all the games in which I have been involved (is that better?). Here goes.

## Images Software

*1991–1993*

I first encountered Images Software when I was there collecting Jim, the bass player in our band. Jim was on some kind of work placement scheme, getting paid a measly sum by the government to make tea. The company was run by Karl Jeffery, and it would later morph into Climax.

### Funky Monkey [unreleased]

I had never created graphics for a game before but I did have some experience working in Art Director on the Atari ST. Images had an original platform game, called Monkey Business, early in development. It needed art and I began work on it. Fairly soon, however, the game was halted and in its a place a new game was born. I redesigned the central character and renamed him Funky Monkey. We spent a few months in development before I moved on. There’s a more detailed account here.

### Extra

I may also have had a tiny involvement with The Hunt For Red October\* on the ZX Spectrum (I think something needed fixing and the artist was out of the office), and a similar thing with G-LOC on Amiga.

\*Jim’s name even appears on the credits for this.

## SCi

*1993–1998*

For the full motion video sequences (FMV) I believe we used Alias PowerAnimator. We rendered out the shots that had been roughly planned on little storyboards, and then edited them together using Wavefront Composer, another unique tool. The game starts in a fairly green environment, moves to a more arctic setting and then the player hitches a ride to the moon. From here they are transported to Mars for the final set of levels. I was quite into the [Fortean Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortean_Times) in the early nineties (Bob Lazaar, Aliens, etc.) and there was a big hoo-ha about [a ‘face’ on Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydonia_(Mars)). I incorporated this into the game and it became the final boss.

I produced all of the 2D graphics. The early levels were preceded by a short mission briefing (which actually used a top down render of the level map). I created a bitmap font (Futura bold italic I think) and the in-game on-screen graphics. These comprised a little map bezel that span around in the corner (modelled and rendered in 3D) and some power-up icons that stacked up on the left hand side of the screen as you picked them up. Finally there was a 3D font that was used in game whenever a pick up was collected or when an objective was destroyed.

## SWIV 3D Assault

For the US release of the game we added an extra set of levels, which took place on the alien home world. There were also a couple of new animated sequences linking these levels to the existing game. [Here is video I compiled of all the FMV sequences from the game](https://youtu.be/1qRdKur3UXo) (also shown below). I can’t find any game play footage from these final levels, although I do have access to a copy of SWIV 3D Assault so hope to be able to grab some.
